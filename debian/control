Description: Manage dynamic plugins for Python applications
 Python makes loading code dynamically easy, allowing you to configure
 and extend your application by discovering and loading extensions
 ("plugins") at runtime. Many applications implement their own library
 for doing this, using **import** or importlib. stevedore avoids creating
 yet another extension mechanism by building on top of setuptools entry
 points. The code for managing entry points tends to be repetitive,
 though, so stevedore provides manager classes for implementing common
 patterns for using dynamically loaded extensions.
